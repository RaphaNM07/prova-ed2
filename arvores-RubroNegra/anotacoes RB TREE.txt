Anotações Árvore Rubro Negra

Propriedades:

1 - Each node is either red or black.

2 - (The root is black.)

3 - All NIL leaves are black.

4 - A red node must not have red children.

5 - All paths from a node to the leaves below contain the same number of black nodes.

- The longest path from the root to a leaf (not counting the root) is at most twice as long as the shortest path from the root to a leaf.

- Black height is the number of black nodes from a given node to its leaves. The black NIL leaves are counted, the start node is not.



Método fixRedBlackPropertiesAfterInsert():

We initially color the new node red so that rule 5 is satisfied.

However, if the parent node of the inserted node is also red, we have violated rule 4. We then have to repair the tree by recoloring and/or rotating it so that all rules are satisfied again. That is done in the fixRedBlackPropertiesAfterInsert() method, which is called in the last line of the insertNode() method.

During the repair, we have to deal with five different cases:

Case 1: New Node Is the Root

Case 2: Parent node is red and the root
	
Case 3: Parent and uncle nodes are red
	
Case 4: Parent node is red, uncle node is black, inserted node is "inner grandchild"

Case 5: Parent node is red, uncle node is black, inserted node is "outer grandchild"
